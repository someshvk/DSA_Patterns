## About this repo

<p>
  Preparing for coding interviews is a hell lot of work, you have to go through a lot. <br>
  Understanding different data structures and algorithms and then solving different questions on them is really very important. Theres no shortcut to that, you would have to solve coding questions. And while solving these coding questions, most of the the times you would notice repetations in the way of solving these questions. You would notice certain patterns to solve these questions.
