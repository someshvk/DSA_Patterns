## About this repo

<p>
  Preparing for coding interviews is a hell of a lot of work. You have to go through a lot. Understanding different data structures and algorithms and then solving different questions on them is very important. There's no shortcut to that; you would have to solve coding questions. And while solving these coding questions, most of the time, you would notice repetitions in the way of solving these questions. You will notice certain patterns in solving these questions. <br><br>
  So, what if you understood these patterns? Will these patterns help you to solve these coding questions?<br>
  Understanding these coding patterns will help you to ace these coding questions. You would be able to identify which question comes under which pattern and cut down on the repetition.

<p>
  This repository contains all these coding patterns, along with questions on them. First, understand what these patterns are and then solve the questions mentioned in every pattern( also provided answers to these questions with explanation ).<br><br>
  I understood these patterns and documented what I have learned so far. So if you want to point out something or have any queries related to this, your feedback is always welcome. Also, if you want to add anything to this repo, you can raise an issue.
